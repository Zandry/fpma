
Wind turbine farm in Bakersfield is launched

Our wind turbine farm, in association with the UCLA alternative energy program, started operation on May 23rd in a 20-acre plot of land in Bakersfield. The property was donated by Oliver Wentworth, UCLA alumnus, and successful California agribusiness leader. The experimental farm will be tested on the Blue Sky housing development, to model energy reduction for the 65-structure complex. Data from the model will be available to the public after six months of operation.
