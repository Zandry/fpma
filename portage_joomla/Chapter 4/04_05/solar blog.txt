Embry house – a model of energy efficiency

John and Linda Embry, of Wisconsin, have just finished construction on their 2,500 square foot, environmentally-friendly, dream house.

The house boasts several hundred 200-watt K-Eco panels, recycled building materials throughout, and bamboo for much of the decorative accents. The house will likely save the Embry’s about $500 a month in heating and cooling in Wisconsin’s drastic seasons, not to mention the money they’ll earn in feeding solar back to the grid.
